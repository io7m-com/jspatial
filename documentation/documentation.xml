      <s:subsection>
        <s:subsection-title>Overview</s:subsection-title>
        <s:paragraph>
          The <s:term s:type="package">io7m-jspatial</s:term> package
          implements several spatial data structures, such as octtrees and
          quadtrees.
        </s:paragraph>
      </s:subsection>

      <s:subsection>
        <s:subsection-title>Simplicity</s:subsection-title>
        <s:paragraph>
          The <s:term s:type="package">io7m-jspatial</s:term> package
          strives for simplicity in interface and implementation. Most
          implementations of the data structures included are less than
          <s:term s:type="constant">700</s:term>
          lines of code (including comments and annotations).
        </s:paragraph>
        <s:paragraph>
          The intention is to allow for ease of understanding of the structures
          and algorithms involved, to increase confidence in their correctness
          and to ease auditing.
        </s:paragraph>
      </s:subsection>

      <s:subsection>
        <s:subsection-title>Efficiency</s:subsection-title>
        <s:paragraph>
          The package provides specialized implementations of the specified
          APIs, with versions for long integer and double precision floating
          point coordinates.
        </s:paragraph>
      </s:subsection>

      <s:subsection>
        <s:subsection-title>Correctness</s:subsection-title>
        <s:paragraph>
          The package includes a large battery of automated tests that attempt
          to verify the correctness of the included implementations. As of the
          time of writing, the tests manage over 96% coverage for all code
          <s:footnote>
            Some of the code is specifically and deliberately unreachable but the
            compiler is unable to verify this without flow analysis.
          </s:footnote>.

        <s:subsection-title>Source compilation</s:subsection-title>
        <s:paragraph>
          The project can be compiled and installed with
          <s:link-external s:target="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</s:link-external>:
        </s:paragraph>
        <s:paragraph>
          <s:verbatim s:type="example"><![CDATA[$ mvn -C clean install]]></s:verbatim>

      <s:subsection>
        <s:subsection-title>Maven</s:subsection-title>
        <s:paragraph>
          Regular releases are made to the
          <s:link-external s:target="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cio7m-jspatial">Central Repository</s:link-external>,
          so it's possible to use the <s:term s:type="package">io7m-jspatial</s:term>
          package in your projects with the following Maven dependency:
        </s:paragraph>
        <s:paragraph>
          <s:verbatim s:type="example"><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>com.io7m.jspatial</groupId>
  <artifactId>io7m-jspatial-api</artifactId>
  <version>[3.0.0, 4.0.0)</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.io7m.jspatial</groupId>
  <artifactId>io7m-jspatial-implementation</artifactId>
  <version>[3.0.0, 4.0.0)</version>
</dependency>]]></s:verbatim>
        </s:paragraph>
        <s:paragraph>
          All <s:link-external s:target="http://io7m.com">io7m.com</s:link-external>
          packages use Semantic Versioning
          <s:footnote>
            <s:link-external s:target="http://semver.org">http://semver.org</s:link-external>
          </s:footnote>, which implies that it is always safe to use version ranges
          with an exclusive upper bound equal to the next major version - the API of
          the package will not change in a backwards-incompatible manner before the
          next major version.
